# First Day of Python

Before you start, run the first.py program by typing 

`python first.py`

next to the $.  Press the return key to see the result.

## Input

The `input` command is used to ask the user to enter something.  Ask the user's name and save it in a variable called `name`.

{% spoiler "Hint" %}

To make a new variable called name, write `name =`.  Follow that with the `input()` function.  You can put a *prompt* inside the parenthesis.  The prompt is a string, so use quotes around it like this `input("Answer this question!")`

{% endspoiler %}

## Print

Now print a greeting to the user using their name.  For instance, if the user's name is Penelope, your program could output "Hello, Penelope".  Make sure you're using the `name` variable so that whatever the user enters is used in the response.  Python has more than one way to do this!  See if you can figure one out!

{% spoiler "Hint" %}

One way to do this in Python is with a formatted string.  An `f` followed immediately by a string in double quotes is a formatted string.  Variables can be placed inside the formatted string inside curly braces { }.  For instance if `pens` is a variable equal to 5, f"I have {pens} pens" would evaluate to "I have 5 pens".  

{% endspoiler %}

## Add More

Write at least three more questions for the user, and respond using their answers.  If you know some Python from another class or self study, feel free to use what you know, as long as you ask the user at least three questions.

## Turn it in 

Turn in your lab with `submit50 LSRHS/checks/firstpython`.  Also answer the questions posted on Google Classroom in the "First Python" assignment.
